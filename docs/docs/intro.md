# Overview

[Mongo Logistics](https://rdbms-comparator.sa-demo.staging.corp.mongodb.com/) is a simple app based on the concept of a logistics company that has customers and orders.
The app uses a Spring-Boot backend to connect to both a MongoDB and Postgres DB.
Using an Angular CLI created web app (hosted inside the spring-boot app) the user can show the approach to query different
sets of records from each of the different backend sources using a toggle switch in the navbar
