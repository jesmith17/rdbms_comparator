# RDBMS Comparator

RDBMS Comparator is a simple app based on the concept of a logistics company that has customers and orders. 
The app uses a Spring-Boot backend to connect to both a MongoDB and Postgres DB. 
Using an Angular CLI created web app (hosted inside the spring-boot app) the user can show the approach to query different 
sets of records from each of the different backend sources using a toggle switch in the navbar
